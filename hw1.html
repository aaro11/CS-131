<h1>Homework 1</h1>

<h2>Due Wednesday, April 6, at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your homework via the course web page as an updated version of the <tt>hw1.ml</tt>
text file that I have provided. 

<h3>Make sure the file can be successfully loaded into the OCaml interpreter
via the <tt>#use</tt> directive; if not you get an automatic 0 for the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

For this assignment, you will get practice implementing a number of
functions in ML.  As important as getting the right behavior is using
the style that is natural for ML and its unique language features.
<b>You will lose style points if any of the following rules are disobeyed</b>:

<ul> <li> <i>Never</i> use imperative features like
assignment and loops.  If you're using a construct not discussed in
class or in the book, you're probably doing something bad!</li> <li>
Use pattern matching instead of conditionals wherever it is possible
to do so.</li> <li> Use local variables to avoid recomputing an
expression that is needed multiple times in a function.</li>
<li>Similarly, avoid code duplication.  If the same code is needed in
multiple places, possibly with slight variations, make a helper function
so that the code only has to be written once.</li>
</ul>

A few other tips: <ul> <li>Remember the key to solving problems with
recursion: Assume you have the result of the recursive call, and then
figure out how to turn that result into the overall answer you desire.</li>
<li>Create any number of helper functions as needed.
</li>
<li> Write comments where useful to tell the
reader what's going on.  Comments in ML are enclosed in <tt>(*</tt>
and <tt>*)</tt>.  The grader should be able to easily understand what
your code is doing.  One useful comment is to provide the type of any
helper function that you define.</li>

<li> Test your functions on several inputs, including corner cases --
we will be doing the same.</li>
</ul>

Now on to the assignment!  I've provided a file <tt>hw1.ml</tt> that declares all the functions you must implement along with their expected types.  Right now each has a dummy, incorrect implementation.  Your job is to modify each function's body to do the right thing.  <b>You will not need to modify anything but the function's body;  if you modify the function's name or type,
you are doing something wrong!</b> 
<ol>
<li> Write a function <tt>fib</tt> of type <tt>int -> int</tt>
  that takes a nonnegative integer
<tt>n</tt> and computes the <tt>n</tt>th Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci series has a natural recursive definition,
which can be used directly to implement your function:  The 0th
Fibonacci number is 0.  The 1st Fibonacci number is 1.  The <i>n</i>th
Fibonacci number, where n is an integer greater than 1, is the sum of
the (n-1)st and (n-2)nd Fibonacci numbers.
  It's fine if your implementation is wildly inefficient.</li>

<p><li>Write a function <tt>clone</tt> of type <tt>'a * int -> 'a
list</tt>.  The function takes an item <tt>e</tt> and a nonnegative
integer <tt>n</tt> and
returns a list containing <tt>n</tt> copies of <tt>e</tt>.  For
example, <tt>clone("hi", 4)</tt> returns <tt>["hi"; "hi"; "hi";
"hi"]</tt>.</li>

<p><li>Write a function <tt>allPos</tt> of type <tt>int list -> int list</tt>
that takes a list of integers and returns a list containing all and only
the positive elements of the original list (in the same order).  For example,
the result of <tt>allPos [1;-2;3;4;-5]</tt> is <tt>[1;3;4]</tt>.


<p><li>Write a function <tt>everyOther</tt> of type <tt>'a list -> 'a list</tt>
that takes a list and returns a list containing every other element
of the original list (in the same order), starting with the first element.
For example,
the result of <tt>everyOther [1;-2;3;4;-5]</tt> is <tt>[1;3;-5]</tt>.
Also, the result of <tt>everyOther []</tt> is <tt>[]</tt>.

<p><li> Write a function <tt>tails</tt> of type <tt>'a list -> 'a list list</tt>
that takes a list and returns a
list of lists containing the original list along with all tails of the
list, from longest to shortest.  For example, <tt>tails [1;2;3]</tt> is
<tt>[[1;2;3];[2;3];[3];[]]</tt>.</li>

<p>
<li>Write a function <tt>reverse</tt> of type <tt>'a list -> 'a
list</tt> that reverses the elements of a list.  <b>You may not simply invoke the function that reverses a list from the OCaml standard library; instead write your own recursive function to do the reversal.</b></li>

<p>
<li>The natural way to write <tt>reverse</tt> takes O(n<sup>2</sup>)
time, where n is the size of the input list.  In particular, there are
O(n<sup>2</sup>) <i>cons</i> calls (<tt>::</tt> in ML).
The reason is that each
call to append (<tt>@</tt> in ML) does a cons for each element of the
left-hand list (recall the way we defined <tt>append</tt> in class).
Therefore, <tt>reverse</tt> performs 1 + 2 + ... + n conses for a list
of size n.

<p> In this problem, you will implement a much more efficient
algorithm for reversing a list, which only requires a linear number of
conses.  Call this function <tt>fastRev</tt>; it will have the same
type as <tt>reverse</tt>.  The key to <tt>fastRev</tt> is that it
builds the reversed list as we recurse over the input list, rather
than as we return from each recursive call.  This is similar to how
  an iterative version of list reversal, as implemented in a language like C,
  would naturally work.
  
<p>  To get the right behavior, your
<tt>fastRev</tt> function should use
a local
helper function <tt>revHelper</tt> to do most of the work.
The helper function should
take two arguments:  (1) the suffix of the input list that remains
to be reversed; (2) the reversal of the first part of the input list.  The helper function
should return the complete reversed list.
Therefore the reversal of an input list
<tt>l</tt> can be performed via the invocation <tt>revHelper(l,
[])</tt>.  I've provided this setup for you in the homework file, so all you have to do is
provide the implementation of <tt>revHelper</tt>.

<p>
The second parameter to <tt>revHelper</tt> is known as an
<i>accumulating parameter</i>, since it accumulates the result as we recurse.
This manner of transforming recursive functions to compute their results as they
recurse down, instead of on the way back up, is a common way to speed up
recursive functions.  In fact, most compilers for functional programming
languages automatically perform this transformation when possible.

<p>Make sure that <tt>fastRev</tt> is indeed much faster than
<tt>reverse</tt>.  On my machine, I can clearly see the difference in
running times of the invocations <tt>fastRev(clone(0, 10000))</tt> and
<tt>reverse(clone(0, 10000))</tt>.  Increase the size of the list if
you can't see the difference.</li>

<p> <li> Consider the following recursive datatype representing the
allowed arithmetic expressions in a simple calculator:

<p><tt>type opn = Add | Sub | Mult | Divide</tt><br>
<tt>type aexp = Num of float | Opn of aexp * opn * aexp</tt>

<p> Values of type <tt>aexp</tt> represent <i>parse trees</i> for
arithmetic expressions.  For example, the expression <tt>(1.0 +. 2.0) *. 3.0</tt> would be
represented by the
value <tt>Opn(Opn(Num 1.0, Add, Num 2.0), Mult, Num 3.0)</tt>.

<p>Write a function <tt>evalAExp</tt> of type <tt>aexp -> float</tt>
that evaluates a given arithmetic expression.  For example, the result of evaluating our expression above should be <tt>9.0</tt>.
</li>

<p><li> Some HP calculators and some programming languages (e.g., the
Java virtual machine language) evaluate expressions using a stack.  An arithmetic computation is expressed as a sequence (i.e., a list) of operations, each of which is represented as a value of the following datatype:

<p><tt>type sopn = Push of float | DoOpn of opn</tt>

<p>The operations are defined to manipulate a stack of floating point
numbers (which we'll represent as a <tt>float list</tt>).  The
operation <tt>Push n</tt> pushes the number <tt>n</tt> onto the stack
(thereby increasing the stack size by 1).  The operation <tt>DoOpn
op</tt> pops the top two numbers <tt>n1</tt> and <tt>n2</tt> off the stack and pushes the result
of evaluating <tt>(n2 op n1)</tt> onto the stack (thereby decreasing the stack size by 1).  <i>Note that the first operand in the computation is the second value popped off the stack, and the second operand is the first value popped off the stack.  This makes a difference for non-commutative operations like subtraction and division.  This behavior makes sense since it corresponds with the order in which the operands were originally computed (and pushed onto the stack).</i>

<p>For example, the arithmetic expression <tt>(1.0 +. 2.0) *. 3.0</tt> can be represented
by the sequence of stack operations <tt>[Push 1.0; Push 2.0; DoOpn Add; Push 3.0; DoOpn Mult]</tt>

<p>Write a function <tt>evalRPN</tt> of type <tt>sopn list * float list -> float</tt> that evaluates a sequence of stack operations in the context of a given stack and then
returns the number at the top of the resulting stack.  Don't worry about the possibility of
stack underflow (but note how the ML typechecker properly warns about this possibility!).
</li>

<p>
<li>
Write a function <tt>toRPN</tt> of type <tt>aexp -> sopn list</tt> that converts
an arithmetic expression into a sequence of stack operations which represents the same computation.
There should be a <tt>DoOpn Add</tt> stack operation
for every <tt>Add</tt> in the input, and so on; evaluating the input expression to a
number <tt>n</tt> and then returning <tt>[Push n]</tt> will get you no credit.
<i>Hint: This function corresponds exactly to a postorder traversal of the input expression
when viewed as a tree.</i>
