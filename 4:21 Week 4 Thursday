(* Week 4 Thursday 4/21/11
Parametric  Polymorphism
------
let rec length lst = 
   match lst with
   [] -> 0
   | x::xs -> 1 + (length xs)

you can think of the type variable as an extra argument

'a is a type variable 
   - can be instatiated with any time
   - this instantiation happens at compile time
  
key point about parametric polymorphism:
   - one piece of code
   - can be used safely with arguments of several different types
