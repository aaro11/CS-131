<h1>Homework 5: Object-oriented Data Structures</h1>

<h2>Due Friday, May 13, at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your homework as a single Java file named <tt>hw5.java</tt>
via the course web
page.  Make sure the file can be successfully compiled with
<tt>javac</tt>.
</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say who you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

<p> Object-oriented languages typically provide a rich hierarchy of
classes that represent common data structures (lists, sets, hash
tables, etc.) and are widely used by programmers.  Java is no exception --- see the
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html"><tt>java.util</tt></a> package.

<p>For this assignment, you will write several implementations of a
simple interface for a <i>set</i> of strings.  Take a look at the
interface <tt>Set</tt> provided in the <tt>hw5.java</tt> file
accompanying this assignment.  A <tt>Set</tt> supports checking
whether a given string is in the set, adding a new string (by
modifying the set in place), and obtaining the size of the set.
(We'll add a few more methods later.)

<p><i>The main point of this assignment is for you to figure out a nice
object-oriented design for each of your <tt>Set</tt> implementations.
I have provided detailed descriptions to guide you, but you need to
think carefully about what design makes the best
use of the object-oriented programming language features.  For example,
make use of inheritance whenever that makes sense, in order to reuse code rather
    than writing the same code multiple times.</i>

<p>As usual, good style
matters.  <b>Here are the rules:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Use interfaces as types
and classes as their implementations, rarely if ever using a class
directly as a type.</li>
 <li><i>Never</i> use type-unsafe features
of Java, like casts and the <tt>instanceof</tt> expression.  If you need
   to ever figure out the class of some object, then your design is not as
   good as it should be.</li>   
<!-- <li>You may not use any -->
<!-- classes from the Java standard library other than <tt>String</tt></li>. -->
<li>You may use any number of helper methods that you require.  Make those
  <tt>protected</tt> or <tt>private</tt> as you see fit.
</ul>

<p>Normally each class or interface would go in its own file, but for
convenience we will keep all of them in one file.

<p><b>Testing your code: </b> We will test your code by creating a client that constructs
instances of all the various classes you implement, calling methods on
them, etc.  You should do the same -- I have provided a <tt>Test</tt>
class for this purpose, along with some sample tests for the first problem below.
You should add a bunch more tests for that problem and for the other ones.  You can
run the tests by compiling <tt>hw5.java</tt> with <tt>javac</tt> and then saying <tt>java Test</tt> at
the command line.

<p>Some things that may help you:
<ul>
<li>All methods that are defined in order for a class to meet some
interface must be declared <tt>public</tt>.
<li> Arrays in Java are similar to those in C, but arrays are
considered objects.  Here is the declaration of a local variable that
is an array of 10 strings:
<tt>String[] arr = new String[10];</tt></li>
<li>Arrays in Java
have a special field called <tt>length</tt>, which you can use to
access its length.  For example, <tt>arr.length</tt> is 10.  The array
<tt>arr</tt> can properly be accessed from index 0 to 9.</li>
<li>Java has built-in string literals similar to those in ML,
like <tt>"hello"</tt>, but Java treats the <tt>String</tt> type as a
class and treats string literals as objects.  You can see the methods
supported by the <tt>String</tt> class <a
href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">here</a>.
Of particular interest are the <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>compareTo</tt>
methods.</li>
<li>Java has <tt>for</tt> and <tt>while</tt>
loops that behave as you would expect.  Java also has a special "for-each" loop for iterating over arrays and other collections.  Check out the <tt>sum</tt> example at the bottom of the page <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html">here</a> for an example with arrays.  Use this loop instead of a regular <tt>for</tt> or <tt>while</tt> loop whenever possible.
</li>
<li>The implicit <i>receiver</i> argument to a method may be referred
to within the method by the keyword <tt>this</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li> Fix the broken implementation of the <tt>Set</tt> interface called
<tt>ArraySet</tt>, which implements sets using an underlying array of
strings to hold the elements of the set.  To do so, 
  implement the <tt>contains</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, and <tt>size</tt> methods.
An <tt>ArraySet</tt> contains a field <tt>elems</tt> for
the array and an
integer field <tt>size</tt>
representing the current number of elements in the set.  The
zero-argument
constructor for <tt>ArraySet</tt> initializes the fields appropriately -- the array initially has
 space for 5 elements.
  The
<tt>add</tt> method should check that the array is big enough before
adding an element to the end of the list.
If the array is not big enough, a larger array
needs to be created, with the current elements copied into it, before
the new element can be added.  A standard approach is to make the
larger array have twice the size of the original array.  This ensures
that you won't have to make a new array very often.  Of course, you
should only add a new element if it is not already in the set.
<p></li>

<li> Arrays are useful, but they aren't very object-oriented.
Fix the broken implementation of the <tt>Set</tt> interface called
<tt>ListSet</tt>, which implements sets using an underlying linked list.
To do so,
  implement the class's constructor as well as the
<tt>contains</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, and <tt>size</tt> methods.
A <tt>ListSet</tt> has a field <tt>head</tt>
representing the head node of the list, and that field has
type <tt>ListNode</tt>.  A <tt>ListNode</tt> is either
an <tt>EmptyNode</tt>, representing the end of the list,
or a <tt>ValueNode</tt>,
which represents a node containing some data.
I've defined these interfaces and classes and provided their fields and constructors, but you have to implement the methods.

<p>A <tt>ListNode</tt> supports the same three operations as
supported by <tt>ListSet</tt>, and <tt>ListSet</tt> should implement
its functionality by calling the appropriate methods on its head node,
which will do most of the work.
New elements should
always be added to the end of the list.
The key design principle is the following: <b>The <tt>ListSet</tt> should never
have to know whether the <tt>head</tt> is empty or not, and a value node should
never have to know whether its <tt>next</tt> pointer is empty or not.</b>
To implement things such that this design principle is followed,
the <tt>add</tt> method for a <tt>ListNode</tt>
has return type <tt>ListNode</tt>,
representing the current node's replacement in the list after the
addition.</i>

<p>The <tt>EmptyNode</tt> is empty (hence the name) -- it does not
store any value. It is really just used as a marker to indicate the
end of the list. Without it, you'd have to instead use
something like <tt>null</tt> to represent the end of the list, which
is less object-oriented and more error prone.  Further, the <tt>EmptyNode</tt> "knows" how to respond to the three messages of a <tt>ListNode</tt>, unlike the <tt>null</tt> value, which supports no useful operations.
<p></li>

<li>Implement the
<tt>SortedListSet</tt> class, which is like <tt>ListSet</tt>
but keeps the strings in sorted order, from least to greatest according to
<tt>String</tt>'s <tt>compareTo</tt> method.  The
implementation of <tt>add</tt> needs to ensure that this invariant is
maintained, and the implementation of <tt>contains</tt> should make
use of this invariant to create a more optimized implementation than
that of <tt>ListSet</tt>.  You
may also need to create new helper classes, like
<tt>SortedEmptyNode</tt> and <tt>SortedValueNode</tt>.
Whenever new classes are necessary,
you should use inheritance to reuse as much code from your
solution to the previous problem as makes sense.
<p></li>

<li>Uncomment the <tt>isEmpty</tt> and <tt>addAll</tt> methods from
the <tt>Set</tt> interface.  These methods should be able to be
implemented once and shared by all the various <tt>Set</tt>
implementations.  Therefore, fix the implemention of the <tt>abstract</tt> class
<tt>AbstractSet</tt>
and modify the existing implementations of the <tt>Set</tt>
interface to inherit (possibly transitively) from
<tt>AbstractSet</tt>.  The <tt>addAll</tt> method should add every
String in the given array to the set; the for-each loop for iterating over
arrays will come in handy
here (see the tips before the first problem above).

<p>Because <tt>AbstractSet</tt> is declared <tt>abstract</tt>, it does not need to implement all the methods of the <tt>Set</tt> interface.
Of course, subclasses that are not abstract must properly implement or inherit the necessary methods.
Therefore, the implementation of <tt>AbstractSet</tt> can safely invoke these methods.  This is an example of a <i>downcall</i>, which
leverages dynamic dispatch to support code reuse.
<p></li>

<li> Java uses a notion of <i>iterators</i> as a uniform way for
clients to iterate over the elements of a data structure, without
having to know about the underlying representation of that data
structure.  Take a look at the <a
href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html"><tt>Iterator</tt></a>
interface in the Java standard library.  The methods allow a client
access to the elements of some collection one by one.  The
<tt>hasNext</tt> method is used to find out if we've seen all elements
already, and the <tt>next</tt> method returns the next element of the
collection to be visited.  Iterators also optionally support a
<tt>remove</tt> method for removing elements from the collection, but
we will not support this functionality (our implementations of this method throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> to indicate this).

<p>Notice that
the <tt>Iterator</tt> interface
is parameterized by a type variable <tt>E</tt>, representing
the type of the elements being iterated over.  In other words, the type
<tt>Iterator&#60E&#62</tt> is akin to an ML type like <tt>'a iterator</tt>.

<p>Collections that support iteration should be declared to meet the
 <a
 href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html"><tt>Iterable</tt></a>
 interface, which provides a method for obtaining an iterator for the
 collection.  Uncomment the <tt>iterator</tt> method signature in
 <tt>Set</tt> and the <tt>extends Iterable&#60String&#62</tt> clause
 in the header of <tt>Set</tt>.  Again note the use of parametric
 polymorphism: <tt>Set</tt> is a subtype of a particular instantiation
 of the <tt>Iterable</tt> interface, and the <tt>iterator</tt> method
 returns an iterator for strings.  Your job is to update <tt>ArraySet</tt> and
<tt>ListSet</tt> to support the <tt>iterator</tt> method (the <tt>SortedListSet</tt> will implicitly inherit this functionality from <tt>ListSet</tt>).  In order to
do so, you will also have to fix the implementation of the classes <tt>ArrayIterator</tt> and
<tt>ListIterator</tt> that respectively are iterators for those two
classes.

<p>Once you've done this successfully, clients will be able to iterate over
your sets.  For example, the following code prints each element of a set:

<p><tt>
Set s = ...;<br>
for(Iterator&#60String&#62 iter = s.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  System.out.println(iter.next());<br>
  }</tt>

<p>The really cool part is that any type that is a subtype of <tt>Iterable</tt>
can be iterated over using the for-each loop, to avoid explicitly manipulating an iterator.
So the following code has the same behavior as the more explicit (and ugly)
code above:

<p><tt>
Set s = ...;<br>
for(String str : s) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  System.out.println(str);<br>
  }</tt>

<p>Use this style whenever possible.

<p>To get experience with a useful feature of Java, you will define
<tt>ArrayIterator</tt> and <tt>ListIterator</tt> as <i>inner classes</i> of
<tt>ArraySet</tt> and <tt>ListSet</tt>, respectively.
Aside from fields and methods,
classes can contain the definitions of other classes, similar to the way that
functions in OCaml can contain nested function declarations.
Using inner classes here makes sense, because the
iterator is really part of the same abstraction as the set, and
the iterator should not be able to be created independently from an
associated set.  Doing this also enables the iterator's
implementation to directly access the fields and methods of its associated
set, since they are in the static scope of the inner class.
For example, the <tt>ArrayIterator</tt> will need access to the
underlying array of elements.

<p> <tt>ArrayIterator</tt> has a field <tt>curr</tt> that holds the
index of the next element to be visited during iteration.  This field
should be intialized to zero, the <tt>hasNext</tt> method should use
<tt>curr</tt> to decide if we've visited all elements of the set, and
the <tt>next</tt> method should return the next element to be visited
and increment <tt>curr</tt>.  The implementation of
<tt>ListIterator</tt> will be similar, except that <tt>curr</tt> is
now a <tt>ListNode</tt>.  You should also add accessor methods
<tt>value</tt> and <tt>next</tt> to the <tt>ListNode</tt> interface,
for use here.  The versions of these methods in <tt>ValueNode</tt>
should return the associated field.  The versions of these methods in
<tt>EmptyNode</tt> can simply return <tt>null</tt>; a less error-prone
way to handle this kind of situation is to throw an
exception, but we'll omit that here for simplicity.

<p>If <tt>javac</tt> gives you a warning that looks like this:
<br><tt>Note: hw5.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.<br>
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.</tt>
<br>
this likely means that you're missing some necessary type parameters (e.g., you're using the type <tt>Iterator</tt> instead of <tt>Iterator&#60String&#62</tt>).  Recompile
with the flag mentioned above to get a useful error message.  The code you turn in should not have compiler warnings.

<p>
</li>

<li>As a simple client of your iterators, implement the
<tt>subsetOf</tt> method in <tt>Client</tt>.  The method should
take two sets and return a boolean indicating whether or not the first set is a subset of
the second set.  This is another good opportunity to use the for-each loop, which will implicitly employ the iterators you implemented above.
The client should naturally do the right thing regardless of what kinds of sets are passed to it.  Isn't separation of interface from implementation great?
