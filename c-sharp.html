<h1>C# Language Report</h1>

<h2>Due on Friday, May 27 at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your report as either a PDF (preferable) or Microsoft Word
document.</h3>

<b>For this project, you will pair up with
another student in the class.  Only one person should submit the
report, and both students will get the same grade. <i>Make sure both
names are on the report!</i></b>
Although different parts of the report may be originally
written by different people, you are both responsible for the content
of the entire document.

<p><b>The report may not be
more than three pages in total.</b>

<p><b>The report may not be turned in late; your late days may only
be used for ordinary homework assignments.</b>

<p>New programming languages are created all the time, and companies have
to consider whether the benefits of moving to a new language outweigh
the costs.  A case in point is C#, an object-oriented programming
language developed at Microsoft a few years back, which has been
gaining traction in industry.

<p> Your task is to write a report that describes two interesting
facets of C#.  It is not enough to simply describe the behavior of
each facet.  You must do some <i>critical thinking</i> about the facet
and discuss it in the context of the things we've learned in
class.  <b>In particular, for each facet, your report must cover the following
material:</b>

<ul>
<li> Provide a concrete code
<b>example</b>
or two.  The examples should illustrate scenarios where the described
  language features can be especially
  useful and should be used to explain the behavior
  of those language features.</li>
<li> Discuss how this facet in C# <b>compares</b> to its treatment in Java
  and also ML (unless it's a facet that only makes sense in an
  object-oriented language).
  Describe both advantages and disadvantages.
  Even if Java or ML doesn't have an
  analogous language feature, discuss how you would achieve similar
  behavior in those languages. 
  It may help to
  refer to the examples you have given above.
  (You may assume that your reader
  already knows Java and ML, so you don't need to describe their approaches in
  detail.)</li>
<li>Make use of the <b>concepts and terminology</b> from our class.</li>
<li>Give your <b>opinion</b> on how this facet is treated in C#.  What do you
like?  What could be improved and how?</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose the <b>first facet</b>
  of C# from the following list to discuss in your
report:

<ul>
<li> Discuss the kinds of parameter passing that C# supports.</li>

<li> Discuss the support in C# for parametric polymorphism (aka generics).
</li>

<li> In C++, methods
cannot be overridden in subclasses unless they were explicitly
declared <tt>virtual</tt> when defined. In contrast, all methods in Java can be
overridden in subclasses unless explicitly declared
<tt>final</tt>.  Discuss how
inheritance and overriding work in C#.</li>

<li>In addition to method overriding, C# supports various forms of
<i>overloading</i>.  Discuss the kinds of overloading that C# has.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose the <b>second facet</b> of C# from the following list to discuss in your
report:

<ul>
<li>C# includes a modifier (like <tt>public</tt>, <tt>abstract</tt>,
etc.) called <tt>unsafe</tt>.  Discuss it.</li>

<li> C# includes something called <i>properties</i>.
Discuss them.
</li>

<li> C# includes something called <i>delegates</i>.
Discuss them.
</li>

<li> C# includes something called <i>indexers</i>.
Discuss them.
</li>

</ul>

Your report must:

<ul> <li><b>Be your own work.</b> For example, your report should not
contain sentences or example code copied verbatim from other sources.
And you should never write sentences that you don't understand.<br>
  Instead, discuss things in your own words
and using your own examples.  Of course, these things can be inspired
by things that you read from other sources.  </li>

<li> Have no spelling
or grammatical errors.</li>

<li> Be legible (i.e., meet the same standards
required for written work in other classes, and thus have sensible line
lengths, margins, fonts, and so forth).
</li>

<li>Address the two chosen facets clearly and accurately.  If there is
not enough space to discuss a facet completely, choose the most
important things to discuss.</li>

<li> <b>Provide a bibliography</b> of the
resources you consulted.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may use any reliable resources on C#, as long as they are
documented in your bibliography. For example, there are several books
on C#, and there is lots of information on the web.
