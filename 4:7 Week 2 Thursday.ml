SCOPING
=====

For a given reference to (or use of) a variable, which declaration does it refer to?

- global declarations
  let x = 3;;
  let double n = n*2;;

- local declarations (static scoping)
  let x = 3 in
    x+4 

# let x = x+1 in x+1;;
- : int = 5

  let x = e1 in e2
  - x is only in scope in e2

  let rec x = e1 in e2
  - x in scope in both e1 and e2

- function parameters
  - n in the double function above

  (function x -> e)
   - x is only in scope in e

in general, you can declare a pattern instead of a variable, 
  and they all have the same scope

- match expressions
  match e with
  p1 -> e1
  | ...
  | pn -> en

*STATIC (LEXICAL) SCOPING*
- a variable use refers to the nearest enclosing definition
  of that variable

(block structuring)

# let x = 45;;
val x : int = 45
# let f y = x + y;;
val f : int -> int = <fun>
# f 3;;
- : int = 48
# let x = 12;;
val x : int = 12
# f 3;;
- : int = 48 (* the x refers to 45 still *)
# x ;;
- : int = 12


Alternative is *DYNAMIC SCOPING*
- a variable use refers to the nearest enclosing definition 
  *at the point of the use dynamically*

let double n = n*2;;

n;;
 > crashes.. in both dynamic and static

double 3 --> evaluate n*2 in a new scope that augments the current scope
  with knowledge that n maps to 3 --> 6

let add =
  (function x ->
    function y -> x+y)

let addTwo = add 2
  --> evaluate (function y -> x+y) in a new scope that augments the current
  scope with the knowledge that x maps to 2

addTwo 8;; --> will crash
  --> evaluate x+y in a new scope that augments the current scope with the
  knowledge that y maps to 8 (crashes)

"scopes" = "environments"

DYNAMIC SCOPING IS BADDDD
