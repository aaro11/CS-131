<h1>Homework 6: Random Literature</h1>

<h2>Due Wednesday, May 25, at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your four Java files 
via the course web
page:
<tt>SequenceCount.java</tt>, <tt>MostCommonSeq.java</tt>, <tt>RandomPhrase.java</tt>, and
<tt>MiniMapReduce.java</tt>.
Make sure the files can be successfully compiled with
<tt>javac</tt>.
</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say who you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

<p>You've already created random art in this class; how about some
random literature?  The idea of this assignment is to mine classic
works of literature for common word sequences and string them together to make
(hopefully) interesting phrases and sentences.
To do this large-scale data processing, you will use Google's MapReduce.

<p>As we discussed in class, MapReduce is a programming paradigm inspired
from functional programming that Google has developed in order to
express their own internal computations over large data sets. Google's
implementation of MapReduce is not available publicly, but <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>
is an open-source version
of MapReduce. It would be ideal to use Hadoop for this assignment, but
Hadoop is a real system, and as with any real system, it takes time
to get familiar with it, more time than one can spend on a single
programming assignment for our class.

<p>As a result, for you to get a flavor of what it is like to program in
MapReduce, we have implemented our own simple version of MapReduce,
called MiniMapReduce, that runs on a single computer. Although
MiniMapReduce does not distribute computations across many computers,
it will allow you to program in the MapReduce model and get familiar
with it. Once you understand the model, your knowledge and experience
will translate into more realistic MapReduce frameworks like
Hadoop.

<p>As usual, good style matters.  In addition to our usual style
rules, make sure that the <tt>javac</tt> compiler never gives you this
warning:

<p>
<tt>
Note: Blah.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.<br>
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
</tt>

<p> This warning indicates that you are not using parameterized types properly.
In particular, you are probably forgetting a type parameter somewhere, for
example declaring a variable of type <tt>List</tt> rather than
<tt>List&#60String&#62</tt>.  If you get this warning, recompile using
the specified flag, and the compiler will point out the errors that you need
to fix.

<p>Now on to the assignment!

<ol> <li> To start, you need to get familiar with the MapReduce programming
model. Read the attached paper on MapReduce, written by its inventors at
  Google.  You only really need to read Sections 1 and 2, but if you are
interested you can also read the rest.  (You might
  also browse through the lecture
  notes on MapReduce from class, which are posted on the course web page.)<p>

  Now unzip the provided zip file (double clicking on it will probably work;
  otherwise try <tt>unzip hw6.zip</tt>), which contains the code for
  MiniMapReduce.</li>
  
<li>
  Java doesn't have first-class functions, as in ML, but they can be
  simulated with objects.  Take a look at the <tt>Mapper</tt>
  interface, which intuitively represents one of the user-defined functions to
  pass to MapReduce.  The interface has a single method named <tt>apply</tt>
  representing this function; note that it has the same type as
  specified for the user-defined <tt>map</tt> function in Section 2.2
  of the MapReduce paper.  So <tt>m.apply(...)</tt>, where <tt>m</tt> is a
  user-defined implementation of <tt>Mapper</tt>, can be used to invoke
  the user's desired mapping function.
  Similarly, our <tt>Reducer</tt> interface has a
  single method representing the user-defined <tt>reduce</tt>
  function.  (For simplicity our reducer returns a single item rather than a list.
  As mentioned in the MapReduce paper, returning 0 or 1 items is the common case.)
  The interface
  <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Map.Entry.html">
  <tt>Map.Entry</tt></a> in Java's standard library represents a
  (key,value) pair.
    Our <tt>MREntry</tt> class implements this interface.
  
  <p>Now look at the file
<tt>WordCount.java</tt>, which gives you an implementation of the word
count example that was covered in class and that was explained in the
MapReduce paper. The <tt>WordCount</tt> class counts the
number of times that words occur in a set of files that are passed in
on the command line. The output is written to a file
<tt>wordcount.out</tt>. To compile the code, type <tt>javac WordCount.java</tt>, and
to run it, type <tt>java WordCount gulliver huckleberry</tt>. This will count the
  words in two classic books we have provided and put the results
  in the file <tt>wordcount.out</tt>. (Many more books can be downloaded from
  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenberg</a>.)
  

<p>All that <tt>WordCount</tt> does is create an implementation of
  <tt>Mapper</tt>, create an implementation of <tt>Reducer</tt>, and then
  use these to create an instance of <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> that solves the
  problem.  The constructor of <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> takes the user's
<tt>Mapper</tt> and <tt>Reducer</tt> implementation.
<tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> also has a function <tt>mapReduce</tt> that
  takes an initial list of (key,value) pairs and performs the mapReduce
computation using that <tt>Mapper</tt> and <tt>Reducer</tt>.  Our
<tt>FileUtil</tt> class has helper methods for reading a file's contents
into a <tt>String</tt> and for writing the results of a MapReduce computation
to a file.

<p>The user-defined implementations of <tt>Mapper</tt> and <tt>Reducer</tt>
use Java's ability to create <i>anonymous classes</i>.  For example, the
first line of <tt>main</tt> in <tt>WordCount.java</tt> creates a new (unnamed)
class that meets the <tt>Mapper</tt> interface, provides an implementation for
<tt>apply</tt>, and creates an instance of this class, all in one declaration.
This is the Java equivalent of anonymous functions like <tt>(function x -> ...)</tt> in ML!
</li><p>

<li>Once you've understood how the word count example works, complete
the implementation of the sequence count code that is found in
<tt>SequenceCount.java</tt>. This mapReduce job should count the 
number of times that each sequence
(represented as a Java <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html"><tt>List</tt></a>) of five words occurs in the files that are passed in 
on the command line. It is very similar to word count, except that you
are not counting words, but rather sequences of words. You simply need to fill in
the implementation of the two <tt>apply</tt> functions in
<tt>SequenceCount.java</tt>, one for the map implementation, and one for
the reduce implementation.  Currently they each just throw an
exception.

<p>You can see from the word count example how to split a string into words.  See the <tt>split</tt> method
of <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html"><tt>String</tt></a> for more details.
That method takes as an argument a pattern to use as a delimiter between substrings to be produced.  The pattern "\s" represents
all whitespace (to represent this pattern in your program you have to "escape" the slash, so the Java string will be "\\s", as you can
see in the word count example).

<p>However, not all of these substrings are words.  For example, splitting the phrase <tt>it was the best of times; it was the worst of times.</tt> will produce (among others) the words <tt>"times;"</tt> and <tt>"times."</tt>.
Extracting just the word part is complex in general.  We'll use a simple heuristic that works well enough to get interesting results.
For each substring, <tt>split</tt> it again with the pattern "[^a-z']", which says you're using everything except lower-case letters and the apostrophe
as delimiters between substrings that you care about.  Now take the first substring produced in the returned array and use that as the
word, throwing the rest away.  In the above example this will have the effect of removing the undesired punctuation.

<p><b>Careful:</b> The <tt>split</tt> method can produce empty substrings, so you'll want to filter those out before creating all
subsequences of size 5.

<p>Once your code is working and compiled successfully with <tt>javac</tt>,
you can type <tt>java SequenceCount filenames</tt> to test your
code on various files; output will be written to <tt>seqcount.out</tt>.  For example, <tt>java SequenceCount dickens</tt>, where <tt>dickens</tt> contains the snippet above,
should produce the following file contents (our framework takes care of printing this file for you from the result you produce; it represents a key-value pair as "key : value"):

<p><tt>[best, of, times, it, was] : 1<br>
[it, was, the, best, of] : 1<br>
[it, was, the, worst, of] : 1<br>
[of, times, it, was, the] : 1<br>
[the, best, of, times, it] : 1<br>
[times, it, was, the, worst] : 1<br>
[was, the, best, of, times] : 1<br>
[was, the, worst, of, times] : 1</tt>

<p>I've also provided the output for running my sample solution on <tt>gulliver</tt> 
to help you figure out if your
code is working correctly on a larger example.
In a Linux or Mac OS X shell, or under cygwin on Windows, you can do <tt>diff seqcount.out seqcount-gulliver.out</tt> to
see how your solution compares to ours.  You should also
test your code on smaller files to make sure it works as expected.</li>
<p></li>

<li>Complete the implementation of the mapReduce job in <tt>MostCommonSeq.java</tt>, which uses the results
from the mapReduce job above.  The goal is to produce for each word, the most common 5-word sequence starting with that word.
The map job takes as input the output from the above problem -- pairs of a 5-word sequence and an integer.  The map phase should
produce for each such pair a pair consisting of the first word in the sequence and a list containing 5 strings:  a string representation of the
number of times the input sequence appears followed by the four remaining words in the sequence.  For example, given the pair
<tt>["it", "was", "the", "best", "of"]</tt> and <tt>1</tt> as key-value input
(represented as a list of strings and an integer), the map phase should
produce the pair <tt>"it"</tt> and <tt>["1", "was", "the", "best", "of"]</tt> (represented as a string and a list of strings).

<p>The reduce job takes as input a pair of a word (e.g., <tt>"it"</tt>) and a list of the values corresponding to that key that result
from the map phase (e.g., <tt>[["1", "was", "the", "best", "of"], ["1", "was", "the", "worst", "of"]]</tt> and produces
the most common 4-word sequence following the given word.  If there is a tie (as in our example), then the earliest one in
sorted order should be used.  So in our example, the result of the reduce phase should be <tt>["was", "the", "best", "of"]</tt>.
It may be useful to know about the static method <tt>Integer.parseInt()</tt> which returns an integer corresponding to a given
string argument (e.g., <tt>Integer.parseInt("5")</tt> returns the number 5).

<p>Once your code is working and compiled, you can type <tt>java MostCommonSeq</tt> to test your
code on the results from the previous problem sitting in <tt>seqcount.out</tt>.
The result will be put in <tt>mostcommonseq.out</tt>.  For example, when <tt>seqcount.out</tt> holds the results shown above
for the Dickens snippet, the result of this phase should be:

<p><tt>best : [of, times, it, was]<br>
it : [was, the, best, of]<br>
of : [times, it, was, the]<br>
the : [best, of, times, it]<br>
times : [it, was, the, worst]<br>
was : [the, best, of, times]</tt>

<p>I've also provided the results from our sample solution when using the sequence count results for <tt>gulliver</tt>.

<p></li>

<li>Now implement the method <tt>genPhrase</tt> in <tt>RandomPhrase.java</tt>.  The method takes as arguments
the output from the second mapReduce job above, a starting word for the phrase, and the number of sequences to string together
in creating the resulting
phrase.  If you ever need a sequence starting from some word that is not the starting word of any sequence, return <tt>null</tt>.
Here are some examples on the results from doing the above two mapReduce jobs on <tt>gulliver</tt>:

<p><tt>
java RandomPhrase on 1<br>
on the day of june<br><br>
java RandomPhrase on 2<br>
on the day of june about nine months after<br><br>
java RandomPhrase i 3<br>
i made a shift to trouble the reader with a particular account of<br><br>
java RandomPhrase once 4<br>
once adorned her majesty's head about two inches but i did not observe all the above articles</tt>

<p>Random literature!

<p></li>

<li>Update our <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> class to handle exceptions that are
thrown by user-defined <tt>Mapper</tt>s and <tt>Reducer</tt>s.  To do so, uncomment the <tt>throws
MRException</tt> clause on the <tt>apply</tt> methods of <tt>Mapper</tt>
and <tt>Reducer</tt>.  The intent is that a user-defined mapper or reducer
can explicitly throw an <tt>MRException</tt>, to indicate to the <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> framework that the current pair of data being processed should not
be included in the overall results.

<p>If you recompile <tt>MiniMapReduce.java</tt>, there
will be a compile-time error, because <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> is not handling
this exception.  Update the implementations of <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt> in <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> to handle an <tt>MRException</tt>
by ignoring the current
invocation of the mapper or reducer and continuing to process the rest of the
data.  Make sure you don't ignore the entire rest of the data by mistake!

<p>Make sure your updated <tt>MiniMapReduce</tt> compiles successfully.  Also
test it out with some mappers and reducers that throw 
exceptions, to make sure it works as intended.
