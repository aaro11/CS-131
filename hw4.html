<h1>Homework 4: Random Art</h1>

<h2>Due Friday, April 29, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Make sure your code can be successfully loaded into the OCaml interpreter;
if not you get an automatic 0 for the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

You should obey our usual style rules and tips from past homeworks, of course.

<p>This homework brings together a number of topics we have studied,
including user-defined types, higher-order functions, structures
(modules), and signatures (module types).  Your job is to write an ML
program to construct psychedelic pictures like the following
two examples.  <p>

<p>
To create these pictures, you will implement a module meeting
the signature <tt>EXPR</tt> shown in <tt>expr.ml</tt>.  The signature
provides a type <tt>expr</tt>, which represents expressions that produce a pixel value for a given x-y coordinate.  By randomly constructing values of type <tt>expr</tt>,
we will in effect be creating
random functions to apply to a grid of pixels, which will
result in interesting artwork.

<p>A value of type <tt>expr</tt> represents a mathematical expression
over the two variables <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  The value
<tt>buildX</tt> represents the expression <tt>x</tt>, and similarly
for <tt>buildY</tt>.  The <tt>buildSin</tt> function produces an
expression that takes the sine of the product of &pi with the argument
expression's value, and similarly for <tt>buildCos</tt>;
<tt>buildAvg(e1, e2)</tt> produces an expression that takes the
arithmetic mean of the two argument expressions' values;
<tt>buildTimes(e1, e2)</tt> produces an expression that takes the product
of the two expressions' values.
<!-- Note that any expression in this -->
<!-- language produces a value between -1 and 1 whenever <tt>x</tt> and -->
<!-- <tt>y</tt> are both in that range. -->
The <tt>EXPR</tt>
signature also includes functions to print an expression as a string
and to evaluate an expression given an x-y coordinate.

<ol>
<li><b>Expression Evaluation:</b> The file <tt>dexpr.ml</tt>
  provides a module <tt>Expr</tt> that meets the <tt>EXPR</tt> signature.  It
  defines the type <tt>expr</tt> to be a recursive datatype.
  However, expression evaluation is totally broken.  Implement the function
<tt>eval</tt> in <tt>Expr</tt>, of type
<tt>expr -> float*float -> float</tt>, to evaluate the given expression at the
given (x,y) location.
You should use the OCaml functions <tt>sin</tt> and
<tt>cos</tt>, as well as the floating-point value
<tt>pi</tt> that I've defined in the module.  Recall that an
expression tree like <tt>Sine(VarX)</tt> corresponds to the
mathematical expression <tt>sin(&pi x)</tt>, and the <tt>eval</tt>
function must be defined
appropriately.

  <p>Test this function on a few sample inputs before
moving on to the next part, including the <tt>sampleExpr</tt> value
provided in <tt>Expr</tt>. You can load all the relevant files into the OCaml interpreter by the directive <tt>#use hw4.ml</tt>.  Use this directive everywhere in the rest of the assignment as well to load your code for testing.  Here are a few sample runs:<p>
<tt> # Expr.eval
(Expr.buildSin(Expr.buildAvg(Expr.buildX,Expr.buildY))) (0.5,0.0);; <br>
- : float = 0.707106781186547462 <br> 
# Expr.eval Expr.sampleExpr (0.1,0.1);; <br> - : float = 0.569335014033423459
  </tt></li><p>

If you're getting sick of writing <tt>Expr.</tt> before the name of
each function, you can type <tt> open Expr;</tt> in the ML interpreter to
make all of the names declared in <tt>Expr</tt> available
at the top level.  So now you can just refer to <tt>eval</tt> directly, instead
of having to say <tt>Expr.eval</tt>.  However, <i>be careful</i>:  If you modify
<tt>dexpr.ml</tt> and reload it into the interpreter, you have
to <tt>open Expr;</tt> again.  Otherwise, you'll still be referring to the
<i>old</i> versions of things at the top level.  Of course, the new versions
will be available as <tt>Expr.eval</tt>, etc.</li><p>

<li><b>Creating Images:</b> 
The file <tt>art.ml</tt> defines a module named <tt>Art</tt>, which
  provides the functionality for creating pictures.
  It includes the <tt>emitGrayscale</tt> and
<tt>emitColor</tt> 
functions, which generate grayscale and color bitmaps
respectively. These functions want to loop over all the coordinates in a
grid of a user-specified size, producing a pixel value for each one.
In a language like C, we'd naturally use a <tt>for</tt> loop for this purpose.
Luckily, we can simulate <tt>for</tt>
loops with higher-order functions!

<p>
In <tt>art.ml</tt>, complete the definition of the
function <tt>forLoop</tt>, of type <tt>int * int * (int -> unit) ->
unit</tt>.  (The type of your version may be more general than this
type, including a type variable in place of a particular type.  That
is fine.)
The argument triple
contains a lower bound, an upper bound, and a function; your code
should apply the given function to all integers from the lower bound
to the upper bound, inclusive. In this way, the function is acting like the body of
the "loop".  If the upper bound is strictly less
than the lower bound, the call to <tt>forLoop</tt> should do nothing.

<p>Notice that the return type of the given function is <tt>unit</tt>.  This
  indicates that the function is used only for its <i>side effects</i>.  In this
  case, the side effect will be writing pixel values to a file.  It may
be useful to know about OCaml's expression of the form <tt>e1;e2</tt>,
which executes <tt>e1</tt>, ignores its result, and then executes
<tt>e2</tt>.   This kind of expression is <i>syntactic sugar</i> for
the expression <tt>let _ = e1 in e2</tt>.  

<p>Test your code with a call like
<tt>Art.forLoop(2, 5, (function x -> print_endline (string_of_int x)))</tt>,
which should print out the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Now produce a grayscale
picture of the expression <tt>sampleExpr</tt>. You can do this by the
invocation 
<tt>Art.emitGrayscale(Expr.eval Expr.sampleExpr, 150, "sample")</tt>.
Notice how currying is used to partially invoke your <tt>eval</tt>
function, in order to effectively turn
<tt>sampleExpr</tt> into a function.  This function is then applied to
each (x,y) coordinate (appropriately scaled to the range [-1,1] in
each dimension)
in a square of the specified size, and the resulting image file is named
"sample.pgm".  
<!-- If you get an uncaught exception <tt>Chr</tt> while producing an -->
<!-- image, -->
<!-- that is an indication that your <tt>eval</tt> function is returning a -->
<!-- number outside the range [-1,1], which should never happen on a correct -->
<!-- implementation. -->
</li><p>

<li> <b>Viewing Images</b>: Some image viewing applications can
directly display <tt>pgm</tt> and <tt>ppm</tt> files, including the
<tt>xv</tt> program which is installed on the SEAS Unix machines.
However, many image-viewing applications require that the image first
be converted to a JPEG.  This can be done with the <tt>ppmtojpeg</tt>
program at the command line as follows: <tt>ppmtojpeg input-file.ppm >
output-file.jpg</tt>.  Despite the name of this program, it will work
for both .ppm and .pgm files.  This program comes with many Linux
distributions as well as with Cygwin for Windows; it is also installed on the
SEAS Unix machines.  If you don't
already have it, you can download <tt>ppmtojpeg</tt> as part of the
Netpbm package.  See the "Pre-Built Distributions" section of the <a
 href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net">Netpbm home page</a> to install
it for your platform.  If you use a Mac and have MacPorts installed,
you can use the command <tt>sudo port install netpbm</tt></li><p>

<li>
<b>Generating Random Expressions:</b> Your next programming task is
to complete the definition of <tt>build</tt> in <tt>art.ml</tt>, of
type <tt>int -> Expr.expr</tt>. The function should produce a random
expression representable as a value of type <tt>expr</tt>.
The integer parameter to <tt>build</tt>
is a maximum nesting
depth that the resulting expression should have. A bound on the
nesting depth keeps the expression to a manageable size; it's easy to
write a naive expression generator that can generate incredibly
enormous expressions.  When you reach the cut-off point (i.e., <tt>depth</tt>
is 0), you can simply return (the representation of)
an expression with no sub-expressions,
such as <tt>x</tt> or <tt>y</tt>.
If you are not yet at the cut-off point,
randomly select one of the forms of <tt>expr</tt> and recursively generate its
subexpressions.

<p> Use OCaml's <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Random.html"><tt>Random</tt> module</a> to get a source of
(pseudo)randomness to use in your implementation of <tt>build</tt>.  In
particular, the function <tt>Random.int</tt>, which returns a random
integer between 0 (inclusive) and some given upper bound (exclusive), should be useful.
(The function that calls <tt>build</tt> takes care of initializing the random number generator via <tt>Random.init</tt>, 
so you don't have to worry about that here.)


<p>A few notes:
<ul>
<li>
A depth of 8-12 is reasonable to
start, but experiment to see what you think is best.</li>
<li>You
need not choose each expression form with equal probability.  If every kind of
expression can occur with equal probability at any point, it is very
likely that the random expression you get will be 
something small, because <tt>VarX</tt> or <tt>VarY</tt> will be chosen
and cut off the recursion.  Since small expressions
produce boring pictures, you should find some way to prevent or discourage
expressions with no subexpressions from being chosen too early.
There are many options for doing this; experiment and pick one
that gives you good results.</li></ul>

<p> You can test your
code by running the function <tt>doRandomGray</tt> of type
<tt>int * int -> unit</tt>,
which uses <tt>build</tt> to create
a random grayscale image.  The first integer argument is
the maximum nesting depth for the random expression to be generated.
The second integer argument is a <i>seed value</i>,
which this function uses to initialize the random number
generator.  These seeds can be arbitrary integers -- a given seed will produce
the same sequence of random numbers (and therefore the same random picture) every time it is used.
The invocation <tt>doRandomGray(d,s)</tt> emits the grayscale
image as a file
<tt>art-d-s.pgm</tt>.

<p>Similarly, the function <tt>doRandomColor</tt> of type
<tt>int * int -> unit</tt> creates a random color image.  
Given a maximum expression depth and a seed for the
random number generator, <tt>doRandomColor</tt>
creates three random functions which are used to produce random red, green,
and blue values, respectively, for each pixel.
The invocation <tt>doRandomColor(d,s)</tt> emits the color
image as a file
<tt>art-d-s.ppm</tt>.  Note the different file extension.</li><p>

<li><b>An Alternate Representation:</b> Rather than using a datatype
to represent an expression, it might be more natural (and possibly more
efficient) to use a function.  After all, a value of type <tt>expr</tt> really
represents a function that takes an x-y coordinate (i.e., a pair of floats)
and returns a pixel value (also a float).
Since the signature <tt>EXPR</tt> hides the representation of the type
<tt>expr</tt>, we are free to change that representation
without affecting clients like the <tt>Art</tt> module.
Accordingly,
the file <tt>fexpr.ml</tt> provides a new implementation of the
<tt>Expr</tt> structure, in which the type
<tt>expr</tt> is just a <i>synonym</i> for the type <tt>float * float
-> float</tt>.  


<p>Complete <tt>fexpr.ml</tt> by properly defining the six "build"
functions (i.e., <tt>buildX</tt>, <tt>buildY</tt>, <tt>buildSin</tt>,
etc.)
as well as the <tt>eval</tt> function, for our new representation of
  expressions.  Hint:  The <tt>eval</tt>
function should now be almost trivial.
The
<tt>exprToString</tt> function cannot be written
successfully, since there is no way to convert an ML function to a
string. Thus, you can leave that as is; it currently returns the
string <tt>"unknown"</tt>.

<p>
To test your code, replace
<tt>#use "dexpr.ml";</tt> in the file <tt>hw3.ml</tt> with
<tt>#use "fexpr.ml";</tt>.  Notice the power of the separation of interface
from implementation.
We completely changed the representation of expressions and
the associated functions.  However, since the new module still meets
the <tt>EXPR</tt> signature, the <tt>Art</tt> structure can remain completely
unchanged, and the implementer of that module need not even be aware of the
change.
